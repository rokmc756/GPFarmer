pgbouncer
=========

This role configures PgBouncer PostgreSQL connection mux utility.

Postgres server performance degrades when handling a high number of connection due to a 1:1 mapping of connection to Postgres backend processes. PgBouncer is a threaded pooler which can reduce the number of backend processes and the handshaking involved in setting up a new connection.

Example group vars
---------------------------------

Ansible handles the templating of userlist.txt, including the md5 hashing.

    pgbouncer_users:
      - name: username
        pass: unencrypted_password
      - name: postgres
        host: unencrypted_password

    pgbouncer_databases:
      - name: "wibble"
        host: wibble.example.com
        port: 5432

    pgbouncer_max_client_conn: 300
    pgbouncer_max_db_connections: 300
    pgbouncer_max_user_connections: 300

    # govern how many backend connections
    pgbouncer_default_pool_size: 80

Requirements
------------

Module is tested with pgbouncer 1.7.2 from the pgdg repository so that is the recommended source for the binary.

However we don't setup the repo here.

Example playbook
----------------

---
- hosts:  "{{ group }}"
  serial: "{{ serial }}"
  become: yes
  vars:
    pgbouncer_users:
      - name: username
        pass: unencrypted_password
      - name: postgres
        host: unencrypted_password

    pgbouncer_databases:
      - name: "wibble"
        host: wibble.example.com
        port: 5432

    pgbouncer_max_client_conn: 300
    pgbouncer_max_db_connections: 300
    pgbouncer_max_user_connections: 300

    # govern how many backend connections
    pgbouncer_default_pool_size: 80

  roles:
    # This deploys psql and sets up the pgdg repo this ensures that a new pgbouncer is installed and psql can be used to administer it
    - ansible-postgresql-client
    - ansible-pgbouncer


Debugging
---------

If pgbouncer fails to start:-

    sudo -u postgres pgbouncer -d /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini -vvvv

Testing a connection to a remote database

    psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U username databasename

Stats
-----

The default 1.7.2 configuration provides peer authentication of the pgbouncer database to show stats.
NOTE: this still requires a userlist.txt entry for the postgres user.

    sudo -u postgres psql -p 6432 pgbouncer -c 'show pool;'

    sudo -u postgres psql -p 6432 pgbouncer -c 'show stats;'


Reloading / restarting
----------------------

Key config changes such as pool sizing do not require a full restart

sudo /etc/init.d/pgbouncer reload
