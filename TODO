- Need to add cgroup feature
In RHEL 7 the following command should be run and gpdb.conf file should be configured.
$ yum install libcgroup libcgroup-tools
$ modprobe netprio_cgroup

$ sudo vi /etc/cgconfig.d/gpdb.conf
group gpdb {
     perm {
         task {
             uid = gpadmin;
             gid = gpadmin;
         }
         admin {
             uid = gpadmin;
             gid = gpadmin;
         }
     }
     cpu {
     }
     cpuacct {
     }
     cpuset {
     }
     memory {
     }
}
