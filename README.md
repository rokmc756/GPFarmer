# What is GPFarmer?
GPFarmer is ansible playbook to deploy Greenplum Database conveniently on Baremetal, Virtual Machines and Cloud Infrastructure.
It provide also many extensions to install such GPText, madlib, GPCC, postgis as well. The main purpose of this project is actually
very simple. Because i have many jobs to install different kind of GPDB versions and reproduce issues & test features  as a support
engineer. I just want to spend less time for it.

If you are working with GPDB such as Developer, Administrator, Field Engineer or Data Scientist you could also use it very useful with
saving time.

# Where is GPFarmer from and how is it changed?
GPFarmer has been developing based on gpdb-ansible project - https://github.com/andreasscherbaum/gpdb-ansible. Andreas! Thanks for sharing it.
Since it only provide install GPDB on a single host GPFarmer support multiple hosts and many extensions to deploy them and support two
binary type, rpm and bin..

# Supported GPDB and extension version
GPDB 4.x/5.x/6.x

GPCC 1/2

GPTEXT 3.x.x

madlib 1.1.x

postgis 2.x


# Supported Platform and OS
Virtual Machines

Cloud Infrastructure

Baremetal

RHEL and CentOS 5/6/7


# Prerequisite
MacOS or Fedora/CentOS/RHEL installed with ansible as ansible host.
At least three supported OS should be prepared with yum repository configured

# Prepare ansible host to run gpfarmer
* MacOS
~~~
$ xcode-select --install
$ brew install ansible
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb
~~~

* Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
~~~
$ sudo yum install ansible
$ sudo yum install sshpass
~~~

## Prepareing OS
Configure Yum / Local & EPEL Repostiory

# Download / configure / run gpfarmer
$ git clone https://github.com/pivotal-jack-moon/gpfarmer

$ cd gpfarmer

$ vi Makefile
~~~
